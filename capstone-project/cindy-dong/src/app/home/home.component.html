                This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data regarding uninsured individuals under the age of
                65 across Virginia counties from 2009 to 2020. The objective of this tool is to provide policymakers and
                researchers with insights into the significant reduction in uninsured rates over time. It aims to
                enhance understanding of how policies and various factors have impacted health insurance coverage in
                these regions.

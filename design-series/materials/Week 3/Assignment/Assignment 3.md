For next week, please create a user interview script (3-5 questions) to gain insight to the wants and needs of the stakeholders whoâ€™ll be using your final data visualization tool. Please come prepared next week to discuss your user interview script with the class. For guidance on creating a user interview script, please see the resource below (also available in the additional resources section of the schedule).

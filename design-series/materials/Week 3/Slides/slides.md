## User Experience

##### How do we engage stakeholders during design?

---

## Review

[Assignment 2](https://github.com/mathematica-mpr/design-d3-training/blob/development/design-series/materials/Week%202/Assignment/Assignment%202.md)

Notes:

* Going over critiques of visualizations from homework

===

### What is User Experience?

* Sits within the framework of User Centered Design (UCD)
* How will a user interact with the designed tool?
* Who are the key stakeholders?

Notes:

- understanding the user's wants/needs
- how the user understands the content area and will engage with the information
- when designing for social impact, HCD tends to get used rather than UCD

Notes:

- foundational diagram created by the British Design Council in 2005
- purpose is to outline at a high level what UCD looks like in practice

- Discover/Research: gain insight into the issue you've identified, talk to lots of people! (diverging)
- Define/Synthesis: focus on the topic you'd like to tackle (converging)
- Develop/Ideation: brainstorming (diverging)
- Deliver/Implementation: creating solutions that work (converging)

### What are some of the UX activities we can do on a project?

- **User interviews**
- User stories
- **Experience mapping**
- Heuristic evaluation
- A/B testing
- **Usability testing**
- Accessibility testing

---

### User Interviews (Discover/Research phase)

- One of the first activities during requirements gathering
- Target stakeholders, SMEs, end users
- Engage with the interviewee to understand their wants and needs
- Synthesize the interview results and identify key themes to highlight in the product's design

Notes: 

- To maximize the benefits of this activity it is important to interview individuals who are the target of the product. This may not always be possible depending on the client.

---

### Experience Map (Discover/Research phase)

- Shows the end-to-end experience a user will have with the tool
- This activity is best suited if the designed tool will touch on an exisitng process/product

Notes:

- A common example is for building dashboards
- Typically, we we build data visualization dashboards to replace an existing product such as a set of excel sheets or power point presentations
- To maximize the effect, it would be useful to know the +/- experience users of the future dashboard have with their current product
- Designers can identify opportunities of the product and minimize or remove painpoints

---

### Usability Testing (Deliver/Implementation phase)

- After the prototype/tool has been developed
- A script that involve asking a set of users (5-10) to complete a set of specific tasks 
- The user is observed to understand how they interact with the tool

Notes:

- Can lead to product changes
- It's ideally done at least twice to prove that the changes found in the first round have been addressed.

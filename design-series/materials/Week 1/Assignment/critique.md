# Assignment 1

## Viz 1
* Initially overwhelming - there's so much going on.
* The total as a line graph was initially confusing to me as most of the chart is comprised of bar graphs.
* Difficult to access actual values, there's just the general sense that some are more or less than others.
* The legend is difficult to read.
* Difficult to compare strategies with regard to a particular product.
* The use of right-hand graph annotations allows chart to accommodate the much larger totals without squishing the non-total bar graphs into oblivion (if both shared left-hand annotations).
* The vertical grey lines make it easier to distinguish graph clusters.
* Clustered bar chart is a good approach to visualizing this data.
* Easy to compare products within a strategy group.

## Alt 1
* Filtering and compression via horizontal scrolling decreases amount of data to process and allows graph to be enlarged.
* Visual separation or "tiling" of components makes them easier to distinguish from one another.
* Legend is somewhat easier to read due to vertical stacking.
* Horizontal grid lines assist value comparison.
* Group by X toggle makes it easy to compare strategies within a product group.
* Total is easier to digest as a bar graph (though a total might not make sense when grouping by strategy).

## Viz 2

* Lack of title, units of measurement, and context makes it difficult to determine overall purpose of chart.
* The text annotations inside and adjacent to bar graphs are visually unappealing and noisy.
* The left-hand annotations are unnecessarily verbose.
* The legend is difficult to read due to text size.
* Does not handle case of very small values well (no room for corresponding annotations).
* In some cases, the annotations do not contrast well against graph.
* Unclear why some annotations have borders.
* Clearly shows how values relate to each other.
* Having the right-aligned bar annotations match color of corresponding bar is a nice touch.

## Alt 2
* Less noise through interactivity.
* The left-hand annotations are less verbose.

## Viz 3
* Difficult to visually distinguish charts from one another.
* Lots of wasted space (packed circle chart, timeline, yes/no bar).
* The pumpkins are definitely not scaling proportionally with corresponding values (though I like the idea).
* Like the general Halloween theme (colors, imagery).
* "Spending on Costumes" puts horizontal bar chart to good use.

## Alt 3
* The waffle chart is squarish, easier to mesh with other tiles, better for visualizing/comparing percentages.
* The line graph is better for visualizing changes between relatively many data points (crucially, though, the pumpkins have been retained).
* The concentric circles diagram saves space and is more visually appealing.

## Viz 4 (Got this from wrong version, whoops!)
* The graphic transitions vertically from color to color, with corresponding percentage values. This gives the false impression that the graphic is a composite graph, and that the percentages relate to each other as their corresponding "bars" relate to each other. Or, one might incorrectly intuit from looking at the graphic that the corresponding percentages add up to 100%.
* The colored portions of the graphic would be easier to use as a composite graph if it were more vertical.
* Questionable font choice for quotes.
* Like the idea of using a person as a composite graph.
* The quotes humanize the numbers.

## Alt 4
* Stacking waffle charts makes it easy to compare percentages (particularly if the perspective can be rotated by user, for instance: https://bl.ocks.org/niekes/613d43d39372f99ae2dcea14f0f90617).

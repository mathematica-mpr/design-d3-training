Week 2 Design Series
Viz 3
1. The visualization is simple and easy to understand.
2. The visualizaiton has a clear purpose: The visualizaiton has a clear title and a good description of the visualizaiton.
3. The visualization is completed: The legend of graph is also very clear and the different shades of color can clear make users distinguish different levels and different categories.
4. The background of the visaualization has scales, which helps users to see the comparison among different return times.
5. For each time categories, the visualization also has a tip of the exact percentage number, which makes users better understand and compare them.
6. The similiar shades of color might cause distractions for some users.

I used barcharts to show different return frequency of different times. The y axis shows the return frequency, and x axis shows different time categories. The visualization is interactive, and users can select what seasons they want ot compare by selecting options at the "COMPARE" dropdown.

Bubble chart
1. The visualization is very comprehensive and it conveys lots of informations. 
2. I think the visualization is easy and simple because users can select different x,y values and the size to see what information they want to display. 
3. The color of bubbles that reprensent each region is very clear and easy to distinguish. The specific country only shows when users click on each bubble.
4. I think the visualizaiton maximizes the data-ink ratio. Every piece of information is neccesary and users can select want they want to see.
5. By selecting specific information of x, y, sizes, Users won't get overwhelmed by lots of information at the same time. The visualization can make users focus on a small portion of information.
6. I also like the "how to use" section because it makes the visualization more accessible for users.
7. Users can also select different displays/shades of colors and different graphs, which also makes the visualization more accessible.
8. The scrolling bar is very cool and makes it more interesting.

I use barcharts to show comparisons among different countries. The X axis stands for the income, and users can select different attributes like birth rate, population,... to see the comparisions.
Different colors of the bars also stand for different regions, the specific country name shows when hovering on a bar.
When clicking on the bar, the visualization transits to a line chart which describes the trend of income of a single country along time. The y axis is also the income or other selected attributes, the x axis is the timeline.

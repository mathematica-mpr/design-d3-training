# Assignment 2

## Part 1

### Notes

- A lot of "ink" due to unnecessary repetition, but the visualization is easy to understand.
- Line graphs are a good choice for performance over an extended time, same for bar graphs and quarterly performance (not quite enough data to merit a line graph on its own IMO, though perhaps quarterly and monthly could be combined as two lines in one chart, perhaps with a toggle corresponding to each).
- The line graphs could be prettier (no red Xs).
- It's not clear what the bar graph colors entail (some yellow bars are taller or about the same height as some green bars).
- I gather that pie charts in general are best for small sets of data, 2-3 slices or so, with significant differences in value for easier comparison. The pie charts work as used here, but are probably not the best choice.
- I don't like the Sales Pipeline table and want to convert it to a more graphical format, but I can't quite make out the content details.

### Alt

- Uses tabs to condense the various graphs, reducing "ink", making for an easier read.
- Uses graph type option buttons so as to retain both bar and line charts (other types could easily be added).
- Uses area graph as an alternative to pie chart + timeline for better comparing revenue distribution over time.

## Part 2

### Notes

- Time lapse option allows for lots of data to be squeezed into one chart, plus time can be manually selected.
- Using radius to represent population size works well, though it'd be nice to also have some way of accessing the actual value.
- Search bar + countries in scrollable form is a neat way to quickly find a particular country. I appreciate that users don't have to first use the search bar to start seeing options.
- Search bar + option selection is a good idea, but the popups obscure each other if their corresponding data points are positioned closely enough.
- Would be neat to have some way of querying the data. For instance, which countries for year X have a life expectancy between Y and Z, and an income level between A and B.
- Quatar is briefly off the chart on some years at default zoom (ex: 2015).
- It's unclear what the corresponding values associated with income levels 1-4 are.
- Mobile friendly.
- Lots of additional touches and options (ex: switching from log to linear).

### Alt

- I find this visualization difficult to significantly improve upon. I tried an interactive geospatial solution, but while comparisons would be easier between neighboring countries (and their cities, neighborhoods, etc, if the data was available), comparisons in general are much more difficult, and only one aspect of the data (population, life expectancy, or income) can be displayed at a time (though there may be ways around this via color, for instance, colorizing graphs in a heatmap fashion or 3D stacked bar graphs).

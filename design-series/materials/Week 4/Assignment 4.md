# Assignment 4

### Create a Wireframe

Create a wireframe that encompasses your decisions for the chart types and interactions of the tool. The wireframe should convey the tool’s layout, data visualizations, and high-level filter and use interaction behaviors. The wireframe should not show actual data, styling/actual text, and complex interactions/drill down behavior.

Please think about the following questions while creating your wireframe. During your final project presentation, you'll be asked to show your wireframe and discuss the design decisions you made.  

- What is the goal(s) of your data visualization tool?
- What are you trying to show?
- Who is your intended audience?
- How did you chose the tool’s format?
    - Dashboard, Exploration, Exploratory
- How does each feature (chart, interaction, etc.) contribute to meeting the visualization goals?

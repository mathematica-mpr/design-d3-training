# Critique

## Notes

- I like the choice of diverging bar graph.
- Difficult to get a sense of how the bars relate to 100% as there's no corresponding reference.
- Difficult to determine the point of the visualization as there're no axis labels or title.
- Placing the category labels in the bars is an interesting idea, but doesn't work well here.
- Placing the percentage labels in the bars immediately adjacent to each other looks nice and is easier to read than if the labels were, say, centered in the bars.

## Alt

- Segmenting the bars into blocks of 20% makes it easier to visually determine approximate percentage.
- Placing the "Democrat" and "Republican" labels in bars of 100% length makes it easier to compare subsequent bars to the max possible, while also serving as a legend.
- Axis labels and title make purpose of visualization more apparent (though I probably didn't correctly guess the intended purpose).

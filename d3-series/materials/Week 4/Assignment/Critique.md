# Week 4 Viz Critique

## Positive

* I like that the bars appear on either side of the y axis.
* The layout clearly showcases that both parties are aligned in some way to a certain issue.

## Negative

* There isn't a title to the viz to tell the user what it is actually trying to display.
* The labels on the bars are not consistently in the same place - some are on the left and some are on the right.
* It is not clear what the numbers mean here.

Viz Critique
1. First, I think the visualization is really clear, and it shows the clear comparision between two groups.
2. The colors (red,blue) is also very clear.
3. Because it's using bar chart, it's very accessible for audiences to understand.
4. I also like the way it shows the categories, which make good use of space and address the information clearly.
5. It has clear text /numbers for each category. However, it doesn't have a title.

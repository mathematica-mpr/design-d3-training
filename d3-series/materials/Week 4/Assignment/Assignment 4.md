# Assignment 4

This assignment focuses on inserting various SVG elements in the DOM using D3. Unless otherwise stated, all tasks should be done using D3.

### Part 1
1. Use the `climate.json` file to create a horizontal bar chart that shows yearly global temperatures. Your chart should meet the following criteria:
    - Use a D3 scale for the x axis. 
    - The width of the bar should be related to the temperature and the each bar should have a label indicating which year that temperature represents.
    - The color of the bar should change each decade (you can choose whichever color you like for each decade)
    - The height of each bar should be 5 pixels with 2 pixels separating each bar. 
    - The chart should have a title, axes, and axis labels

### Part 2
1. Use `air_quality.csv` to create a vertical bar chart that shows emissions by state. Your chart should meet the following criteria:
    - Use a D3 scale for the x and y axes
    - The height of each bar should represent emissions and each bar should represent a state
    - Color each bar by region
    - The chart should have a title, axes, and axis labels

### Part 3
Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.


### Materials
1. `Assignment 3.md`: This document
2. `data.json`: The data that you will use throughout this assignment
3. `Viz Critique.png`: Visualization to critique

### What to submit
1. Your visualizations:
    - `climate.html`: Part 1
    - `air_quality.html`: Part 2
2. `Critique.md`: Your critique from Part 3
3. `Alt.[ext]`: Your alternate design from Part 3

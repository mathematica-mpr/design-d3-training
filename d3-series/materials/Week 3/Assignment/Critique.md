# Viz Critique

<!-- Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data. -->

### Positive

* The color scheme and simplicity of the visualization is nice and makes it easy for the user to take it in.

### Negative

* The labels for the x-axis could be simplified to remove the year 2014. Instead of adding 2014 for every month, 2014 could be added to the visualization title.
* There are two labels for the y-axis, which is confusing. When there are two y-axis labels, it makes it difficult for the user to tell which label goes with the bar chart and which label goes with the line graph.
* It is not clear what the OrderID represents. An ID implies a unique number associated with a specific order, but that is not shown in the visualization.
* The amount line graph covers one of the labels of the bar graph.

## Notes

- The purpose of this chart is immediately clear.
- Use of red inverted bar graphs to depict casualties as dripping blood is compelling, if morbid.
- The subdued coloration of most of the secondary graphics emphasizes the red.
- "The biggest killers" section could be clearer. Are the deaths arranged chronologically as the bar graphs are? Is there significance in the fact that two of the circles are overlapping?
- The ISF deaths area chart is partially obscured by that of Coalition deaths, and half of it lies off the page. This, together with the fact that they're not just aggregated with the Coalition deaths, conveys to me that ISF lives are less important/relevant in some way, which I find problematic.

## Alt

- I found this visualization difficult to significantly improve upon as a static piece. However, adding interactivity allows for better presenting the secondary data that's sorta squeezed into smaller visualizations arrayed around the primary visualization.
- I aggregated most of the secondary visualization into an interactive map that uses doughnut charts to indicate number of casualties by region (indicated by raw number and radius of chart) along with cause of death (assuming this data is available), and moved this onto a separate tab. This makes the secondary data more accessible and de-clutters the primary visualization.
- I don't know quite how to handle "US ground troops in Iraq". Ideally this could be integrated into the primary bar graph in some way, but I can't think of a way of doing this that doesn't deemphasize the casualties. Another thought is moving this data into the interactive map.

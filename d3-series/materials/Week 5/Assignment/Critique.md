# Week 5 Viz Critique

## Positives

* I like how this viz takes the content it's displaying and themes it to how it is being displayed. It's dramatic and immediately gets the point across.
* I like that important events are pointed out on the timeline.

## Negtaives

* It's not immediately clear who the victims are. Does the viz represent American fatalities, military, or all victims?
* There is a label in the middle of the viz that displays coalition and civilialian death counts at a certain point in time. But the breakdown isn't displayed anywhere else.
* The gray scale of the smaller visualizations doesn't draw my eye to them. In particular, the map's color scale doesn't have a lot of contrast.

## My Viz

* I tried to simplify the viz by removing the extra graphs.
* I added a legend since it wasn't clear to me at first that the viz was displaying two types of casualties
* I put the blurb under the title because I felt like that better explained the relevance of the viz.
* I changed the label "Montly fatalities" to "Fatalities". While it does seem like monthly fatalities are probably displayed, the X-axis only shows years.

Viz 1

Notes and Comments:
1. The Barcharts make the comparisons among different products clear. We can have a clear sense that which strategy has the highest value.
2. The line chart shows a clear comparison of total product values under each strategy.
3. The color of different product bars is very clear.
4. In the visualization, we have 7 different products under each strategy category, I think the dataset the chart represents is tidy long data.
5. The total product values and the single product values do not share the same scale, and audience might have to look for the scales back and force. 
6. The title of the chart is "Compare sales strategy", and it serves as a good title if we compares the total product values among each strategy (the chart also shows the comparision within each strategy).However, if we want to compare the the same product of different strategies, the chart might be a little distracted.

Discription for Alt 1:
1. I follow the same logic as Viz 1 and I compare the total product values among different strategies.
2. Instead of showing a barchart with a linechart, I use stack barchart to visualize the total values of each strategy and the each stack can show the distribution of each product value within a strategy.
3. Instead of using two scales, I only use one scale to compare the strategies.

Viz 2

Notes and Comments
1. The visualization doesn't have a title, description, and the units of scales.
2. The legend and color show too more categories.
3. The numbers listed with each stack are not clear.
4. The visualization shows the comparision among different categories:cold, Thraot, Vitamin, etc, and the stack shows the inner distribution of each part.
5. There are positive and negative numbers for the percentage numbers, and there's no explaination for these.
6. The dataset is tidy since the visualization also uses long dataset.

Description for Alt2
I use the combination of line chart and piecharts. The line chart shows the total amount of each category, and the comparision among each categories.The pie chart shows the percentage of each distribution in each category. The area of picharts is also relatively proportional to the total amount of each category.


Viz3

Notes and Comments
1. The visualization has a clear title, and it shows each percentage of how baby boomers describe themselves.
2. The visualization is clear and fun, and it use the shape of a human for a better illustration.
3. The color of each category is clear, and we can distinguish them easily.
4. However, the percentage numbers don't sum up to 100% so that I think there are people who belong to two or more groups. The way that each colored area is completely separate from each other cannot fully describe the dataset.
5. In the visualization, the red is 61% and the purple is 78%. However, the red part looks bigger than the purple one.The areas are not proportional to the number. It's also hard to make number absotuly proportional to the area in the this shape.
6. There are also comments for tech-savvy and creative categories, which make hthe visualization more interesting.

Description for Alt3
Because the percentages do not sum up to 100%, there are overlaps in each categories. I'll use a simple barchart to visualize the dataset.The barchar can clearly show the comprision among each category.

## Web Concepts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

### 3 Components

- **HTML**: Content and structure
- **CSS**: Appearance
- **JavaScript**: Dynamism and interaction

Notes:

- JavaScript is actually taking over a lot of the domain once covered by HTML and CSS
  - JS can generate HTML & CSS too
  - Front-end frameworks

---

### HTML

Basic structure

Example (index.html)

---

### DOM

Document Object Model: should be thought of as an API into your document.

<img class="img" src="materials/Week 3/Slides/resources/ExampleDOM.png" style="width:80%">

---

### CSS

Casading Style Sheets: Add style and much more

<div style="font-size: 0.5em">Inline Styles</div>

```html
<div style="color:red">Hello world</div>
```

<div style="font-size: 0.5em">Internal Style Sheet</div>

```html
<style>
  .my-class {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<div class="my-class">Hello world</div>
```

<div style="font-size: 0.5em">External Style Sheet</div>

```html
<link rel="styles.css" />
<div class="my-class">Hello world</div>
```

```css
.my-class {
  color: red;
}
```

### JavaScript

- High level, single threaded, garbage collected, interpreted, or just in time compiled, prototype based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language with a non-blocking loop

---

### High level

Relative to the hardware, lowest level is machine code.

---

### Single threaded

There is one event loop. This is really imporant for a lot of what we do in the web

---

### Garbage collected

Memory management, this process is obfuscated from us.

---

### Interpreted, or just in time (JIT) compiled

The computer runs the code line by line each time (sort of). JIT compiles just before runing but there is executeable that can passed around.

---

### Prototype based

Class extention all the way up. Every object has a prototype, which allows us to re-use functionality by attaching it to the prototype.

---

### Multi-paradigm

JS doesn't lock us into Imperative (OOP, procedural, parallel processing) or Declarative (Logic, Functional, database)

---

### Dynamic language

No types.

```
let x = 'a';
x = 1;
```

---

### Non-blocking loop

Asynchronous

---

- Used to manipulate the DOM

```js
document.querySelector('body').append('<p>Hello world</p>');
```

- Or add interaction and <span id="dynamic">dynamic content</span>

```js
document.getElementById('dynamic').onclick = function () {
  var i = 21;
  var mult = 1;
  setInterval(function () {
    if (i === 60) mult = -1;
    if (i === 20) mult = 1;
    mult === 1 ? i++ : i--;
    document.getElementById('dynamic').setAttribute('style', 'position:fixed; top: 40%; left:' + i + '%');
  }, 20);
};
```

---

### Asynchrony in JS

- Code doesn't always execute 'in order'

```js
console.log('Mathematica');

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Policy');
});

let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  if (true) {
    resolve('progress');
  } else {
    reject(Error('together'));
  }
});

promise.then(
  (x) => console.log(x),
  (err) => console.log(err)
);

console.log('Research');
```

Note:

- Talk about reasoning behind this
- Always be aware

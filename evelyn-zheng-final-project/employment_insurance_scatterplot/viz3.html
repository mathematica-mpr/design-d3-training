        <p>The following data visualization explores the relationship between the percentage of state populations that are employed
            and the percentage with private health insurance. It aims to observe potential correlations between the two values by plotting
            county data in a scatterplot.

        <h4>HOW (X,Y) POINT VALUES ARE CALCULATED</h4>
        <p><b>Average Percentage of {state} Employed =</b> Σ(Percent of {county} Employed) / {Number of counties}</p>
        <p><b>Average Percentage of {state} with Private Health Insurance =</b> Σ(Percent of {county} with Private Health Insurance) / {Number of counties}</p>
        <h4>HOW TO USE THIS VISUALIZATION</h4>
        <p><b>STATE SELECTION:</b> Use dropdown menu to select states and their counties for display in the scatterplot chart. 
        </p>
        <p><b>LINE OF BEST FIT:</b> The red line on the plot represents the best fit for the state data selected. It is accompanied
            by an equation in the format <i>y = mx + b</i>, allowing users to observe the magnitude of the correlation.

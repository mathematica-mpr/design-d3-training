# Final Project

For the final project, each student will create a data visualization tool. The data visualization should convey a clear purpose that enables the audience to explore and analyze the data with ease. The goal of the data visualization should be defined as a “How might we…” question(s), which is a statement commonly used in design thinking to frame your design challenge and acts as a starting point for ideation. An example of a “HMW” statement is “How might we educate a general audience about the anthropogenic drivers of climate change?"

The data visualization must use the d3.js library and contain the following:

1. At least three different types of charts/visualizations
2. At least two types of interaction (click/hover/scroll events, tooltips, filtering)
3. At least one transition

At the end of the internship, each student will present their data visualization tool to the class. As a part of the final project presentation, please walk through the journey of creating the data visualization tool by touching on the following:

- What data set did you choose to create the data visualization tool?
- What is the goal(s) of your data visualization tool?
  - How did you identify which metrics from the data set to use in the tool?
  - Who is your intended audience of the tool?
- What design decisions went into creating the tool?
  - How did you choose the tool’s format (exploration, narrative, infographic), chart types, and user interactions? How do they support the goal of the data visualization tool?
  - If there was intention behind the layout, colors used, etc. please speak to those as well.
- After visualizing the data, did you discover any interesting patterns or characteristics of the data?

Please submit a brief document with your answers to the above questions in addition to your data visualization tool.

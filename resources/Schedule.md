### **Week 3 (Design series):** How can we engage stakeholders during the design phase?

#### Key Concepts

- What is UX?
- Explore different User Experience (UX) activities to perform with the intended audience and stakeholders. These activities include:
  - User interviews
  - User stories
  - Experience mapping
  - Heuristic evaluation
  - AB testing
  - Usability testing
- Discuss examples of UX project work at Mathematica
  - What was the project’s design brief?
  - What was your process for conducting the design activities?
  - Tools/technologies used
  - Mathematica-specific considerations?

#### Assignment

1. Find a data set for the final project!

2. An important step of the requirements gathering process is interacting with stakeholders to understand their role, perspective, wants, and needs of the tool. For next week, please create a user interview script to gain insight to the wants and needs of the stakeholders who’ll be using your final data visualization tool. Please come prepared next week to discuss the user interview script with the class. For guidance on creating a user interview script, please see the additional resources section.

### **Week 4 (Design series):** How do we construct a prototype?

### Key Concepts

- Discuss the use cases of creating prototypes at varying levels of detail
  - Wireframes
  - Low fidelity
  - High fidelity
- Tools and technologies you can use to create prototypes
  - Figma
  - Adobe XD/Illustrator
  - Observable notebooks
- Discuss examples of UI design project work at Mathematica
  - What was the project’s design brief?
  - What was your process for conducting the design activities?
  - Tools/technologies used
  - Mathematica-specific considerations?

### Assignment

Create a wireframe that encompasses your decisions for the chart types and interactions of the tool. The wireframe should convey the tool’s layout, data visualizations, and high-level filter and use interaction behaviors. The wireframe should not show actual data, styling/actual text, and complex interactions/drill down behavior.

Please think about the following questions while creating your wireframe. During your final project presentation, you'll be asked to show your wireframe and discuss the design decisions you made.  

- What is the goal(s) of your data visualization tool?
- What are you trying to show?
- Who is your intended audience?
- How did you chose the tool’s format?
    - Dashboard, Exploration, Exploratory
- How does each feature (chart, interaction, etc.) contribute to meeting the visualization goals?
